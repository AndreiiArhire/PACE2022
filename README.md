# AFC - An Heuristic Solver for the Directed Feedback Vertex Set Problem
This is a an heuristic solver for the directed version of the feedback vertex set problem, used in the Seventh Edition of [Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments](https://pacechallenge.org/). A feedback vertex set of a graph is a set of nodes with the property that every cycle contains at least one vertex from the set i.e the removal of all vertices from a feedback vertex set leads to an acyclic graph. For a brief description of the solver, we refer the following paper ([PDF](https://andrei-arhire.web.app/assets/AFC_SOLVER.pdf)).

## Required
C++ 11 or higher

## How to run    
The input graph is given via the standard input, which follows the Metis file format described [here](https://pacechallenge.org/2022/tracks/#input-format). 

The solver will output the solution via standard output in [this](https://pacechallenge.org/2022/tracks/#output-format) format.
